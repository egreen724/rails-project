## Motivation and Features
The Roam Activity Tracker was created as a portfolio project in the Flatiron School's Full Stack Software Engineering program.  The goal was to fully apply my understanding of Ruby on Rails by creating a complex web app. The Roam Activity Tracker allows users to track outdoor activities, such as hikes, bike rides, and kayaking trips, that are added by other system users, add these activities to their "To Do List", and track the date and time of specific trips.

This project allowed me to expand my knowledge of Rails through complex object relationships while adding other features such as bcrypt and Omniauth.

## Technologies

* Rails 5.2.3
* Ruby 2.5.1
* sqlite3
* ActiveRecord


## Setup

1. Ensure that your system is running the correct versions of Rails and Ruby.
2. Clone into the repository and change directories into "roam_app".
3. Run "rails server" to open the app in your browser.
